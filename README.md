### About me
Always was interested in a programming, started to learn a web-development in a free time as a hobby. 

2014 - 2022 worked as a [game environment artist](https://www.artstation.com/cgdima) from an idea, reference search and scheduling work to final assets in the game.



I enjoy learning new things and taking on new challenges, and I believe my experience 
in both creative and technical roles gives me a strong foundation in problem-solving 
and teamwork that allows me to approach problems innovatively.
